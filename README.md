# Trunk Recorder MQTT Status Plugin

This is a plugin for Trunk Recorder that publish the current status over MQTT. External programs can use the MQTT messages to display what is going on.

## Install

1. **Build and install the current version of Trunk Recorder** following these [instructions](https://github.com/robotastic/trunk-recorder/blob/master/docs/INSTALL-LINUX.md). Make sure you do a `sudo make install` at the end to install the Trunk Recorder binary and libaries systemwide. The plugin will be built against these libraries.

2. Now, **install the Paho MQTT C & C++ Libraries**. The full documentation for that is [here](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp#unix-and-linux)... but the basic commands are as follows:

*Install Paho MQTT C*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
cd paho.mqtt.c

cmake -Bbuild -H. -DPAHO_ENABLE_TESTING=OFF -DPAHO_BUILD_STATIC=ON  -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=ON -DPAHO_HIGH_PERFORMANCE=ON
sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
sudo ldconfig
```

*Install Paho MQTT C++*
```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.cpp
cd paho.mqtt.cpp

cmake -Bbuild -H. -DPAHO_BUILD_STATIC=ON  -DPAHO_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=TRUE -DPAHO_BUILD_SAMPLES=TRUE
sudo cmake --build build/ --target install
sudo ldconfig
```

3. Build and install the plugin:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

## Docker

The included Dockerfile will allow buliding a trunk-recorder docker image with this plugin included.

`docker-compose` can be used to automate the build and deployment of this image. In the Docker compose file replace the image line with a build line pointing to the location where this repo has been cloned to.   

Docker compose file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  recorder:
    build: ./trunk-recorder-mqtt-status
    container_name: trunk-recorder
    restart: always
    privileged: true
    volumes:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb
      - /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus 
      - /var/run/avahi-daemon/socket:/var/run/avahi-daemon/socket
      - ./:/app
```
